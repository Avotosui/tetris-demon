Research simulated annealing and applications for this? GASA apparently???? 
Research SRS and T-Spins (more reward?)
Tucking and stuff if it can work fast enough (or just deal with it)
- BFS with a piece rotation trait to determine if it fits? Might be really inefficient lmao

Try out deleting the height penalty and then making aggregate height -> aggregate height squared
